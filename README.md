Moving Forward this assumes you have everything setup, now to install the project either download the .zip file and extract or navigate to an empty directory and clone this repo:

1. Modify `src/config/Constants.js` with your details respectively.
2. Run `npm start` on the project root directory.
4. Now sit back relax and enjoy exploring the website!

## Important

When you intially run the website you will have access to two dashboards one for your customers which will be accessed by them normally through the url `https://[your-domain]/` and the second is your administration dashboard which can be accessed by you through the url `https://[your-domain]/admin`.

Creating an account as a customer is easy and happens through the natural process of registering through the website, however there is no by default account created for administration so you will have to do it manual and post a request to your backend server thats running to create your admin account.
one easy way to do this is using the application [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/), follow the steps below:

0. Setup [Megatrade Server](https://github.com/AbdeenM/megatrade-backend/).
1. Open Postman and chose to make a post request to the url `[your-backend-url-same-as-in-constants.js]/api/admin/register`
2. Under headers tab on postman enter a key `Content-Type` and value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
3. Under body chose `x-www-form-urlencoded` and enter the follow key/value pairs:
    1. `firstName` -    `your-admin-first-name`
    2. `lastName` -    `your-admin-last-name`
    1. `email` -    `your-admin-email-for-login`
